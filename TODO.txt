TODO:

trace the execution flow from rs_linkAtPoint down. you should be able to match that execution flow with tests, and the tests linking together should give confidence that everything works as intended

create an acceptance test in the form of an example project - does it actually detect a link (that rs link says should be one). use a real UITextView.

extract methods that are categories of UITextView that don't belong there.
